## Agent Present

Our [Agent Present demo](https://cobrowseio.github.io/cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples/agent-present/) demonstrates how to provide your own UI for the agent present mode.

#### Setup

To run this demo please clone this repo or download [this file](https://cobrowseio.github.io/cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples/agent-present/index.html) and make the edits below.

1. Add your own license key to line 16.
2. Add an agent JWT generated using your public and private key pair.
3. Replace the partial private key seen on line 91 with your private key. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND COMMITING YOUR PRIVATE KEY. THIS IS ONLY FOR DEMO PURPOSES.

With those changes made you can now launch the agent present demo.

#### Running the demo

1. Open the `index.html` page in your browser that can be found in the `agent-present` folder.
2. Copy the present URL and open in a new tab.
3. Click the *Share my desktop* button and choose what to present.
4. See the agents screen now presented to the viewer in the tab that was opened in step 2.

## Recording Samples

In [recordings](recordings/) you can find useful scripts to programatically download or delete session recordings from your account.
