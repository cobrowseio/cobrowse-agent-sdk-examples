# Agent SDK Example

This example shows how you can customize the agent-side UI for Cobrowse. You can try it out online: navigate to our [Custom Agent Demo Page](https://cobrowseio.github.io/cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples/custom-agent-demo/) to automatically start an agent session and simulate the agent and customer experience.

This demo page uses our [Agent JS API (JavaScript SDK)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cobrowse-agent-sdk) in this example project which you can run locally.

# Checkout the code
```sh
git clone git@github.com:cobrowseio/cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples.git
cd cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples/custom-agent-demo
```

### Run the example
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

A new browser window should open automatically. You can then enter a demo id from our online demo at https://cobrowse.io/demo to add some devices.
